ðŸ‘‹ Oh look, a visitor! Let me get the text out...

### Welcome to my GitHub profile!
This is the place my projects are stored.
I really like to develop web-based applications using my small JavaScript libraries **[pwa](https://github.com/ljans/pwa)**, **[elements](https://github.com/ljans/elements)** and **[idb](https://github.com/ljans/idb)**.
Besides that, I'm very interested in maths & physics, some related work of mine can also be found here.
